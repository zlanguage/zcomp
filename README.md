# Z

A transpiled language that can be evaluated as a script (for testing) or transpiled to human-readable JS (for production code). Z supports modules, functions, closure, error handling, and many more features you would expect from a modern language. Is it ready for production code? I'd wait a few months before that.

# ZComp

The Z Compiler (ZComp) can be installed with:

```sh
$ npm install -g @zlanguage/zcomp
```

Then, you should install the zstdlib (a mix of a runtime and standard library):

```sh
$ npm install -g @zlanguage/zstdlib
```

Next, install `globby`, which is essential to the Z Compiler:

```sh
$ npm install -g globby
```

Finally, navigate to the directory you're using Z in, and type:

```sh
$ npm link @zlanguage/zstdlib
```


However, if you are using Z for a web app (or npm package), and want to deploy it to the world, instead run the following two commands:
```sh
$ npm init
$ npm install @zlanguage/zstdlib
```
This installs the Z standard library locally in just the paackage you need it for.

# Use The Compiler

Transpile Z Code:
```sh
$ zcomp transpile [path of Z to transpile] [path of where to output the transpiled JS]
```
Run Z Code:
```sh
$ zcomp run [path of Z to run]
```
Transpile one directory to another:
```sh
$ zcomp dirt [path of directory with Z] [path of "out" directory]
```
Watch a file for changes, and transpile when the file is changed:
```sh
$ zcomp watch [path of Z to watch and transpile] [path of where to output the transpiled JS]
```
